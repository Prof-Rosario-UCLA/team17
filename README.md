Triv.AI is a full-stack, multiplayer trivia web platform that dynamically generates questions using OpenAI. Built with React, Node.js, WebSockets, MongoDB, and WebAssembly (via AssemblyScript), the app lets users join rooms, compete in timed rounds, and interact with real-time score updates.

## üåê Live Deployment

Triv.AI is deployed on **Google App Engine (GAE)** with continuous integration via **Cloud Build**. HTTPS is enabled by default using App Engine's `*.appspot.com` subdomain.

---

## üöÄ Deploying the App (Google App Engine)

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- A Google Cloud Project
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated (`gcloud init`)
- APIs enabled:
  - Cloud Build API
  - App Engine Admin API
  - Cloud Resource Manager API

---

### 1. **Set up your scripts in `package.json`**:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "start": "node src/server/server.js"
  }
````

> Install `serve` locally:

```bash
npm install --save-dev serve
```

---

### 2. **Create `app.yaml`** (for Google App Engine):

```yaml
runtime: nodejs20

entrypoint: npm start

handlers:
  - url: /
    static_files: dist/index.html
    upload: dist/index.html

  - url: /(.*)
    static_files: dist/\1
    upload: dist/(.*)

  - url: /.*
    script: auto

readiness_check:
  path: '/_ah/ready'
  check_interval_sec: 5
  timeout_sec: 4
  failure_threshold: 2
  success_threshold: 2
  app_start_timeout_sec: 300
```

---

### 3. **Create `.cloudbuild.yaml`** (for CI/CD):

```yaml
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
  args: ['install']
  dir: '.'

- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
  args: ['run', 'build']
  dir: '.'

- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
  args: ['app', 'deploy', '--quiet']
  dir: '.'

timeout: '900s'
```

---

### 4. **Push to GitHub & Configure Cloud Build Trigger**:

* Connect your GitHub repo to Google Cloud Build.
* Create a trigger for the `main` branch.
* Set build config to `.cloudbuild.yaml`.

---

## üì¶ Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
